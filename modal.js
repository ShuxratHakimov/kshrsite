Its peculiarity is that these factors represent not only territorial-production structures, but also national-cultural and natural-climatic formations. The state of the economy of rural areas largely determines the economic results of the region, which actualizes the need to find adequate forms and methods of managing the development of the agrarian region. In this regard, the task of assessing the level of socio-economic development of rural areas comes to the fore.<br>The object of this project was the Kegeli and Chimbay districts of the Republic of Karakalpakstan.<br>The purpose of the study is to analyze and evaluate the socio-economic and agricultural development of the Kegeli and Chimbay districts, as well as to evaluate the current state of farms selected for demonstration sites.<br>This study attempts to make an objective analysis of the current socio-economic situation and agricultural development, as well as an assessment of the current state of farms selected for demonstration sites, Kegeli and Chimbay districts based on statistical information, data from the State Committee for Land, Geodesy, Cadastre, expert and analytical calculations.

The purpose of the visits was to familiarize with the project area, collect information on natural and economic conditions, farming practices, problems and needs. Meetings and consultations were organized with specialists, scientists and representatives of local organizations.<br>Study tasks - Location and natural and climatic conditions:<br>Location and related climatic conditions are the most important factors affecting ecosystems, biodiversity and agriculture. The Republic of Karakalpakstan is located in the northwestern part of Uzbekistan and is a vast lowland plain with elevations from 50 to 200 m above sea level.<br> According to the natural and climatic zoning, the territory of Karakalpakstan belongs to the northern desert zone, characterized by high dryness of the air, scanty precipitation, high temperatures in summer and low temperatures in winter. The aridity of the climate determines the fragility and instability of ecosystems, and inadequate human intervention disrupts the natural balance. It is the climatic features that are the root cause of land degradation, which is superimposed by anthropogenic activity and provokes the intensive development of degradation processes. The success of the socio-economic development of the state is determined, first of all, by such components as demographic parameters and population migration. These indicators are considered indicators of the state of society.</p>",
